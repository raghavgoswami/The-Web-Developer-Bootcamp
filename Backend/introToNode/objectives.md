#Intro to Node

#What is Node? Server-side JS. Why are we learning it? 
#Trendy, but much more importantly, it's in JS! No need to learn a new server-side language like Python, Ruby, PHP, etc. Longterm it doesn't matter b/c web dev changes very fast and you will be exposed to other languages.

#Using Node
#Interact with Node console
#Run a file with node
